        `As an experienced Full-Stack Developer with 2 years of experience 
        in the telemarketing industry, I specialize in software development, 
        system integration, and support. In my role, I helped establish
        and lead a support team that handled all support needs, including bugs,
        network issues, and production issues both minor and major. 
        As a full-stack developer, I contributed to the development of 
        new features when the dev team was too backed up. Additionally, 
        I monitored pre-existing issues, reported them, and worked to find and 
        fix them. Through these efforts, I helped ensure smooth and uninterrupted
        operations for our clients. I am proficient in React, Java, SQL,
        JavaScript, and Python, and am enthusiastic about staying up-to-date
        with the latest technologies and expanding my skills. With an Associate's
        degree focused on Programming and Web Development from Advanced Training
        Associates, I am equipped with the knowledge and skills to take on new challenges
        and make valuable contributions to any team.`
